# JS-Project-5-Public-API-Requests
I want my project to be graded with the exceeds expectations requirements.
If my project does not meet these requirements, I would prefer for my
project to be rejected.






Below are the CSS styles I added for the Exceeds Expectations Requirements.
CSS:
Added 'background-color: #E0E0E0' on the '.card' class to give it some subtle
difference from the background color of the page.

Added 'box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px 1px #888888' to 'modal-btn-container .btn'
to add a little bit of subtle "depth" to the buttons

Added 'box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px 1px #888888' to the '.modal' class.
Similar to the modal-btn-container .btn I did this to add some depth, and while
I'll be doing something similar to this on a few other elements, I bet there are better ways to
do what I actually envision, but I'm not too familiar with CSS and the project
guidelines specify what I need to do, so I guess styling will be something I explore
at a later date.

Added 'box-shadow: 2px 2px grey' to the modal-btn-container class.  Just Added
for consistency within the modal window, but tried some different property
values for my own learning purposes.  

You can find all of these additions at the bottom of the class they are associated with
